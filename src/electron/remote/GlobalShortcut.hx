	Process: Main
	
	The `globalShortcut` module can register/unregister a global keyboard shortcut with the operating system so that you can customize the operations for various shortcuts.
	
	> [!NOTE] The shortcut is global; it will work even if the app does not have the keyboard focus. This module cannot be used before the `ready` event of the app module is emitted. Please also note that it is also possible to use Chromium's `GlobalShortcutsPortal` implementation, which allows apps to bind global shortcuts when running within a Wayland session.
