If access has already been requested and denied, it _must_ be changed through the preference pane; an alert will not pop up and the promise will resolve with the existing access status.
		
		**Important:** In order to properly leverage this API, you must set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSCameraUsageDescription` strings in your app's `Info.plist` file. The values for these keys will be used to populate the permission dialogs so that the user will be properly informed as to the purpose of the permission request. See Electron Application Distribution for more information about how to set these in the context of Electron.
