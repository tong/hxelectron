		Child processes typically cache trace data and only rarely flush and send trace data back to the main process. This helps to minimize the runtime overhead of tracing since sending trace data over IPC can be an expensive operation. So, to end tracing, Chromium asynchronously asks all child processes to flush any pending trace data.
		
		Trace data will be written into `resultFilePath`. If `resultFilePath` is empty or not provided, trace data will be written to a temporary file, and the path will be returned in the promise.
